Crossupgrade phpBB_14 -> pnForum
--------------------------------

First step: create a backup!
then: save the backup somewehere..
then: take a deep breath....


During the installation all the data fro the old phpBB_14 tabls will be copied to the
new pnForum tables, so the old data still exist.

These steps have proven to do the upgrade in the best way:
* remove all user permissions to phpBB_14 to avoind new postings durig the upgrade
* remove phpBB_14 blocks
* init pnForum (phpBB_14 must be activated in order to copy the database tables)
* deactivate phpBB_14
* activate pnForum
* recreate new permissions (see new permission schema below)
* add pnForum blocks


The permission schema has been changed:

instead of

phpBB_14:Category Categoryname::
phpBB_14:Forum Forumname::

we now have

pnForum::  CategoryID:ForumID:

If you want to forbid my guests to access an internal forum (e.g. CategoryID 7, ForumID 12)
you would use

unreg. User | pnForum:: | 7:12: | none

Moderators for this forum:

Moderatorgroup | pnForum:: | 7:12: | moderate

Is there another Forum (ID 14) in the catgory, you an also use

Moderatorgroup | pnForum:: | 7:(12|14): | moderate

As usual, you need the comment right to write new postings.

Users | pnForum:: | .* | comment

allows all registered users to write in all forums.

Upgrade from pnForum 2.6 or even older version
----------------------------------------------
