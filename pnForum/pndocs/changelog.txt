  is not longer done in program code but is now part of the template logic. There are two new fields in

IMPORTANT NOTE:
- since bbcode and smile functions are moved to hooks you'll need the pn_bbcode and pn_bbsmile hooks from http://www.pnforum.de or http://snowbankih.tzo.com
- with pn_bbclick you can convert url- and mail-adresses to links automatically - might be usefull, too ;)
- BBCODES AND SMILIES ARE NOT SHOWN WHEN pn_bbcode and pn_bbsmile ARE NOT INSTALLED & ACTIVE!
